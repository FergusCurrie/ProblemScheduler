# ProblemScheduler
Scheduling for text book problems (not point doing all of a similar problem set in one go)

# Generator
Used to put problem sections per chapter into csv

# scheduler
Used to query next problem

# add_review
Used to record a review

# Additoins?

- Stack saving each change to rewind easy.

- allow add review (y/n) from scheduler to save time 
- allows specific book and chapter weightings to control what u see. -
    - this is kinda done but the scheduler could be better. annoying resulst is how sequential it is. perhaps shuffle by chapter?

- scheduler is too linear. chuck a log ontop so that it priorities less towards end of chapter.
- add some randomness, pretty boring rotating through all questions 1s. 
    - on this we don't have to add review based on what the scheduler says.
